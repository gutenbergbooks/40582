<h3>
<span>CIBBER'S LIVES OF THE POETS.</span>
</h3>

<p>It is rather extraordinary that none of Dr. Johnson's biographers appear
to have been aware that the prospectus of Cibber's <i>Lives</i> was furnished
by Johnson. In Mr. Croker's last edition of <i>Boswell</i> there is a long
note (see Edit. 1848, p. 818.) on the claim of Theophilus Cibber to the
authorship of the <i>Lives</i>, or a participation in it: but though he
remarks that the plan on which these <i>Lives</i> are written is
substantially the same as that which Johnson long after adopted in his
own work, his attention does not seem to have been directed to the
prospectus of Cibber's <i>Lives</i>. As, however, this prospectus was not
adopted as a preface to the work, but merely appeared in the newspapers
and periodicals of the day, it is the less surprising that it has
hitherto remained unnoticed. The internal evidence is decisive; and, as
it has never, that I am aware of, been reprinted, and is of great
interest in connexion with Johnson's own <i>Lives of the Poets</i>, of which
admirable work it may be considered to have "cast the shadows before,"
at the distance of nearly thirty years, I trust, though rather long, it
may claim insertion in "N. &amp; Q." It is extracted from a London newspaper
of the 20th February, 1753.</p>

 <p class="noindent center">"To the Public.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The Professors of no Art have conferred more Honour on our Nation than
the Poets. All Countries have been diligent in preserving the Memoirs of
those<a id="Page_26"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[26]</span> who have, either by their Actions or Writings, drawn the
Attention of the World upon them: it is a Tribute due to the illustrious
Dead; and has a Tendency to awaken, in the Minds of the Living, the
laudable Principle of Emulation. As there is no Reading at once so
entertaining and instructive, as that of Biography, so none ought to
have the Preference to it: It yields the most striking Pictures of Life,
and shews us the many Vicissitudes to which we are exposed in the Course
of that important Journey. It has happened that the Lives of the
Literati have been less attended to than those of Men of Action, whether
in the Field or Senate; possibly because Accounts of them are more
difficult to be attained, as they move in a retired Sphere, and may
therefore be thought incapable of exciting so much Curiosity, or
affecting the Mind with equal Force; but certain it is, that familiar
Life, the Knowledge of which is of the highest Importance, might often
be strikingly exhibited, were its various Scenes but sufficiently known,
and properly illustrated. Of this, the most affecting Instances will be
found in the Lives of the Poets, whose Indigence has so often subjected
them to experience Variety of Fortune, and whose Parts and Genius have
been so much concerned in furnishing Entertainment to the Public. As the
Poets generally converse more at large, than other men, their Lives must
naturally be productive of such Incidents as cannot but please those who
deem the Study of Human Nature, and Lessons of Life, the most important.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The Lives of the Poets have been less perfectly given to the World,
than the Figure they have made in it, and the Share they have in our
Admiration, naturally demand. The Dramatic Authors indeed have had some
Writers who have transmitted Accounts of their works to Posterity: Of
these Langbain is by far the most considerable. He was a Man of
extensive Reading, and has taken a great deal of Pains to trace the
Sources from which our Poets have derived their Plots; he has given a
Catalogue of their Plays, and, as far as his Reading served him, very
accurately: He has much improved upon Winstanley and Philips, and his
Account of the Poets is certainly the best now extant. Jacob's
Performance is a most contemptible one; he has given himself no Trouble
to gain Intelligence, and has scarcely transcribed Langbain with
Accuracy. Mrs. Cooper, Author of <i>The Muses Library</i>, has been
industrious in collecting the Works and some Memoirs of the Poets who
preceded Spenser: But her Plan did not admit of enlarging, and she has
furnished but little Intelligence concerning them.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The general Error into which Langbain, Mrs. Cooper, and all the other
Biographers have fallen, is this: They have considered the Poets merely
as such, without tracing their Connexions in civil Life, the various
Circumstances they have been in, their Patronage, their Employments, and
in short, the Figure they made as Members of the Community; which
Omission has rendered their Accounts less interesting; and while they
have shewn us the Poet, they have quite neglected the Man. Many of the
Poets, besides their Excellency in that Profession, were held in Esteem
by Men in Power, and filled civil Employments with Honour and
Reputation; various Particulars of their Lives are to be found in the
Annals of the Age in which they lived, and which were connected with
those of their Patron.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"But these Particulars lie scattered in a Variety of Books, and the
collecting them together and properly arranging them, is as yet
unattempted, and is no easy task to accomplish. This however, we have
endeavoured to do, and if we are able to execute our Plan, their Lives
will prove entertaining, and many Articles of Intelligence, omitted by
others, will be brought to Light. Another Advantage we imagine our Plan
has over those who have gone before us in the same Attempt is, that we
have not confined ourselves to Dramatic Writers only, but have taken in
all who have had any Name as Poets, of whatsoever Class: and have
besides given some Account of their other Writings: So that if they had
any Excellence independant of Poetry, it will appear in full View to the
Reader. We have likewise considered the Poets, not as they rise
Alphabetically, but Chronologically, from Chaucer, the Morning Star of
English Poetry, to the present Times: And we promise in the Course of
this work, to make short Quotations by Way of Specimen from every
Author, so that the Readers will be able to discern the Progress of
Poetry from its Origin in Chaucer to its Consummation in Dryden. He will
discover the gradual Improvements made in Versification, its Rise and
Fall; and in a Word, the compleat History of Poetry will appear before
him. In the Reign of Queen Elizabeth for Instance, Numbers and Harmony
were carried to a great Perfection by the Earl of Surry, Spenser, and
Fairfax; in the Reign of James and Charles the First, they grew harsher;
at the Restoration, when Taste end Politeness began again to revive,
Waller restored them to the Smoothness they had lost: Dryden reached the
highest Excellence of Numbers, and compleated the Power of Poetry.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In the Course of this Work we shall be particular in quoting
Authorities for every Fact advanced, as it is fit the Reader should not
be left at an Uncertainty; and where we find judicious Criticisms on the
Works of our Authors, we shall take care to insert them, and shall
seldom give our Opinion in the Decision of what Degree of Merit is due
to them. We may venture, however, in order to enliven the Narration as
much as possible, sometimes to throw in a Reflection, and in Facts that
are disputed, to sum up the Evidence on both Sides. But though the Poets
were often involved in Parties, and engaged in the vicissitudes of
State, we shall endeavour to illustrate their Conduct, without any
satirical Remarks, or favourable Colouring; never detracting from the
Merit of one, or raising the Reputation of another, on Account of
political Principles."</p>

   writers as imaginary, and his book as a fictitious dramatic
   composition."&mdash;<i>Dr. Hales:</i> <i>See</i>
D'Oyly and Mant's <i>Bible</i>.</p>


<p>But Hales goes on to prove from the sacred writings that Job was a
<i>real</i> character, and that<a id="Page_27"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[27]</span> his history is entitled to credit. That
such a person as Job <i>was</i> a real character, and that he lived about the
time asserted of him, I am about to give a very remarkable proof, quite
independent of Scripture testimony.</p>

<p>In Kæmpfer's <i>Am&oelig;nitates Exoticæ</i>, there is a plate describing two
processions, one after the other: of the first but little mention is
made; of the second, the place from which the procession set out is not
mentioned, but the place of its final destination is Persepolis. It is
separated, in Kæmpfer, from the interpretation thereof, by a few leaves;
but as I have not his <i>Exoticæ</i> by me, I cannot give an exact reference
as to pages; it will, however, be easily found, since the inscription
contains twenty-four lines, and the plate, I think, precedes it. It is
called "Inscriptio Persepolitana," and is evidently among the <i>most
ancient</i> of Cuneiform inscriptions. As neither the inscription, nor the
word I am about to point out, could probably be inserted in the "N. &amp;
Q.," I must be content to describe the word in the clearest manner
possible.</p>

<p>The lines, if I mistake not, measure about 5-¾ inches in length, and
at about 1-¼ inches from the beginning of the <i>second</i> line (beginning
at the left hand, and measuring towards the right) is a word compounded
of four letters (five wedges), and reading <i>a i u b</i>. Take a wedge and
form them thus,&mdash;<i>sharp</i> point to the <i>right</i>, near the top of the
group, is <i>a</i>; sharp point <i>downwards</i> is <i>i</i>; sharp point to the left
is <i>u</i>; the two under wedges <i>joined</i>, viz. sharp point to the blunt
part of the second, is <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian-Cuneiform should
have precisely the same letters for the name of Job. It may lead to some
conclusion with which I shall not meddle. See again D'Oyly and Mant, and
the comment of Bishop Sanderson in ch. i. v. 3., "and not improbably he
was a <i>king</i>."</p>

<p>Refer again to the plate, and behold him in <i>two</i> places, <i>i.e.</i> in both
processions, <i>crowned</i>. And now examine the word following, <i>Aiub</i>; it
is compounded of four letters, <i>easily</i> distinguishable. The first is a
T, scil. the Coptic
<span>
<img src="images/image01.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Coptic" />  </span>, the mystic cross, as may be shown in
the Chinese language; the second is <i>a</i>, compounded of the horizontal
wedge and the following perpendicular one; the third, or perpendicular
line, is <i>i</i>; and the last two, one under the other, is <i>j</i>, or the
Persian
<span>
<img src="images/image02.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="[Persian letter variant]" />   </span> or
<span>
<img src="images/image03.jpg" width="15" height="15" alt="[Persian letter j]" />   </span>, <i>j</i>; making altogether
<span>
<img src="images/image04.jpg" width="25" height="20" alt="[Persian word taij]" />   </span>
<i>taij</i>, <i>being crowned</i>. These two words, therefore, represent the
patriarch as being a king, "Aiub taij," "Job crowned."</p>

<h3>
<span>A NEW ZEALAND LEGEND.</span>
</h3>


<p>The following legend was related to me by a gentleman when discoursing
upon the customs of the New Zealanders. It is their account of the
origin of their land, and illustrates the absurdities which they
believe.</p>

<p>"Old Morm (Query, rightly spelt) was a great fisherman, and being at one
time in want of fish-hooks, he quietly killed his two sons, and took
their jaw bones for hooks. As a requital to them for the loss of their
lives, he made the right eye of his eldest son the morning star, and the
right eye of his youngest son the evening star. One day he was sitting
on a rock fishing with one of the jawbones, when he hooked something
extraordinarily heavy,&mdash;whales were nothing to <i>him</i>. However, this
resisted all his endeavours, and at length he was obliged to resort to
other means to land this monster. He caught a dove, and tying the line
to its leg, he filled it with his spirit, and commanded it to fly
upwards. It did so, and without the least difficulty raised New Zealand!
Old Morm looked at this prodigy with wonder, but thinking it very pretty
he stepped ashore, where he saw men and fire. The first thing he did was
to burn his fingers, and then to cool them he jumped into the sea; when
the sulphur which arose from him was so great, that the Sulphur Island
was formed. After this things went on smoothly, till the New Zealanders
began to get refractory, and so offended the sun, that his majesty
refused to shine. So old Morm got up one day early and chased after the
sun, but it was not till after three days' hard hunting he managed to
catch him. A good deal of parleying then took place, and at last the sun
consented to shine for half the day only. Old Morm, to remedy this evil,
immediately made the moon, and tied it by a string to the sun, so that
when one went down it pulled the other up."</p>

<p>I did not hear on what authority this was given, but I dare say some of
your learned correspondents may have met with it, and will be kind
enough to give it, and say whether this fable was believed by <i>all</i> the
tribes of New Zealand.</p>

<h2>
<span class="bla">Queries.</span>
</h2>


<h3>
<span>ARE OUR LISTS OF ENGLISH SOVEREIGNS COMPLETE?</span>
</h3>



<p>It must have often occurred to students of English history that the
current and usual lists of English sovereigns somewhat arbitrarily
reject all mention of some who, though for short periods, have enjoyed
the regal position and power in this country. There will at once occur
to every reader the names (first) of the Empress Maud, who, in a
charter, dated Oxford in 1141, styled herself "Matilda Imperatrix,
Henrici regis filia, et Anglorum Domina;" (secondly) the young King
Henry, the crowned son of Henry II.; and (thirdly) Lady Jane Grey, who,
in a few public and private documents, is cited as "Jane, Queen of
England, Domina Jana, Dei Gratia Angliæ, Franciæ et Hiberniæ Regina,"
&amp;c.</p>

<p>I am desirous now of calling the attention of your historical readers to
the second case, my attention to the subject having been specially
directed thereto by recently consulting the <i>Chronicon Petroburgense</i>
(edited for the Camden Society by Mr. Stapleton), in which occur various
notices of Henry, the crowned son of Henry II., as Henry <i>III.</i> I beg to
quote these passages. Under the year MCLXIX. the chronicler records
that&mdash;</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"Hic fecit Henricus Rex coronare filium suum ab archiepiscopo
   Eborum."</p>


<p>Sir Harris Nicholas, in his <i>Chronology of History</i>, states that he was
crowned on Sunday the<a id="Page_29"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[29]</span> 14th June, 1170. Benedictus Albus Roger, of
Wendover (<i>Flowers of History</i>), says that "<span class="smaller">A.D</span>. 1170, on the 13th of
July," the king's eldest son was crowned by Roger, Archbishop of York.</p>

<p>His wife Marguerite, of France, was also afterwards crowned in England,
in consequence of her father's complaint that she had not been included
in the former coronation of her husband, Henry the younger (Rex Henricus
junior), as he was commonly styled in this country; <i>li reys Josves</i> in
the Norman language, and <i>lo reis Joves</i> in the dialect of the southern
provinces of France. He himself afterwards assumed the title of <i>Henry
III.</i> regarding his father as virtually dead, owing to the fond, but
thoughtless, assertion of his indulgent sire, at the period of the son's
coronation, that "from that day forward the royalty ceased to belong to
him,"&mdash;"se regem non esse protestari." (<i>Vit. B. Thomæ</i>, lib. ii. cap.
31.)</p>

<p>The <i>Chronicon Petroburgense</i>, again, under the year 1183, records the
death of the younger king in these words, "Obiit Henricus tertius rex,
filius Henrici regis;" and afterwards notices the monarch usually styled
Henry <i>III.</i> as "Henricus rex iiii.<span class="topnum">tus</span>," Henry <i>IV.</i> Sir Harris
Nicholas says, that Henry the younger is also "called by chroniclers
Henry <i>III.</i>"</p>

<p>It is a curious point, because such a distinction must often surely have
been made in the days of the jointly reigning Henrys, and immediately
after that time. The father and son certainly seemed to have been
regarded as for years jointly reigning. For example, Roger of Wendover
records that, in 1175, William of Scotland declared himself the liegeman
of Henry, for the kingdom of Scotland and all his dominions, and did
homage and allegiance to him as his especial lord, "<i>and to Henry the
king's son</i>, saving his faith to his father." In the following year both
went through England, "promising justice to every one, both clergy and
laity, which promise they afterwards fully performed." (Roger of
Wendover.) Surely, then, for distinction sake, if not as a matter of
right and custom, the younger Henry should have been always styled Henry
III.; and if so, while he (not to mention the Empress Maud and Queen
Jane) shall remain excluded, therefore, may I not again with some show
of reason ask, are our lists of English sovereigns complete?</p>

 <span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
Ribbesford and Highlington, near Bewdley (Worcestershire), about the
twelfth century. Several legends, approaching very near to facts, are
extant in this neighbourhood concerning him; one of the best
authenticated is as follows:</p>

<p>Hunting one day near the Severn, he started a fine buck, which took the
direction of the river; fearing to lose it, he discharged an arrow,
which, piercing it through, continued its flight, and struck a salmon,
which had (as is customary with such fish in shallow streams) leaped
from the surface of the water, with so much force as to transfix it.
This being thought a very extraordinary shot (as indeed it was), a stone
carving representing it was fixed over the west door of Ribbesford
Church, then in course of erection. A description of this carving is, I
believe, in Nash's <i>History of Worcestershire</i>, but without any mention
of the legend. The carving merely shows a rude human figure with a bow,
and a salmon transfixed with an arrow before it. A few facts concerning
this "John of Horsill" would be hailed with much pleasure by your well
wisher,</p>

<span><i>St. Crispin's Day.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;In the parishes of Cuckfield and Hurst-a-point in

kept with much rejoicing. The boys go round asking for money in the name
of St. Crispin, bonfires are lighted, and it passes off very much in the
same way as the fifth of November does. It appears, from an inscription
on a monument to one of the ancient family of Bunell in the parish
church of Cuckfield, that a Sir John Bunell attended Henry V. to France
in the year 1415, with one ship, twenty men-at-arms, and forty archers;
and it is probable that the observance of this day in that neighbourhood
is connected with that fact. If so, though the names of&mdash;</p>

<span><i>Poem by Camden.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;Where is the Latin poem by Camden, <i>De Connubio Thamæ
et Isis</i>, to be found?</p>

<p>Camden (in <i>Britannia, sine Regnorum Anglæ Chorographica Descriptio</i>,

the reputed author, viz., page 215, 19 lines; page 272-3, 64 lines; page
302, 12 lines.</p>

<p>Dr. Kippis, <i>Biographia Britannica</i>, article "Camden," in vol. iii.,
assigns the poem to Camden; and Dr. Robert Watt, <i>Bibliotheca
Britannica</i>, speaks of it under <i>Isis</i>, and refers to a translation of
it by Basil Kennet, the brother of White Kennet, Bishop of Peterborough.</p>

<p>These authorities induce me to think either the Latin poem, or the

   <i>Hertfordshire</i>, p. 3., speaking of the word <i>Tamesis</i> being a
   compound of the two rivers Tame and Isis, says, "Of this Mr.

   the marriage of these two streams <i>in his Britannia</i>." As to Dr.

<span>MORAVIAN HYMNS.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 502.)</span>
</h3>


<p>I offer P. H. the best information I have. It is scanty, but as a few
years ago there was much<a id="Page_31"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[31]</span> competition for Moravian hymn-books,
probably some fortunate possessor of an <i>editio princeps</i> may be induced
to tell us more about them.</p>

<p>Of the editions which I have seen, the later is always <i>tamer</i> than its
predecessors. I have one entitled <i>A Collection of Hymns, consisting
chiefly of Translations from the German. Part 3. The Second Edition.
London: printed for James Hutton, Bookseller in Fetter Lane, over
against West Harding Street</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">MDCCXLIX</span>. After the manner of German
hymn-books, though in verse, it is printed as prose. I have never seen
Part I. or II.; and though a book which had reached a second edition
only a century ago cannot, under ordinary circumstances, be scarce,
several booksellers and book-fanciers, who have seen mine, declare that
they think it unique. It is probable that ridicule and misconstruction
induced the heads of the congregation to make great alterations and
omissions in fresh editions, and to recommend the destruction of the
old, as a means of avoiding scandal. Very good reason they had for so
doing, as the meaning of spiritual love is often so corporeally
expressed as to make Tabitha's dream, in the <i>New Bath Guide</i>, fall far
short of the intensity of the serious work. I cannot find the "chicken
blessed," as cited by Anstey, but have no doubt that it is genuine, as
well as those in the <i>Oxford Magazine</i>. At page 86. of my copy is a
different version of that given by P. H. It is called the "Single
Sister's Hymn." Tune: "How is my heart," &amp;c.</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"To you ye Jesu's Wounds!</p>
    <p>  We pay</p>
      <p>A Thousand thankful tears this day,</p>
    <p>  That you have us presented</p>
    <p>  With many happy</p>
     <p> Virgin-Rows,</p>
      <p>Who without nunnery, are close to Jesu's heart cemented.</p>
  <p>    This is a bliss which is sure</p>
     <p> To secure</p>
     <p> Virgin-carriage,</p>
      <p>In the state itself of marriage."</p>

</div>

<p>It is obvious that this is an amended version. I believe these hymns
were translated by persons not very familiar with the English language.
The versification is occasionally good and harmonious, but generally
lame, and the language abounding with Hebraisms and Germanisms. The
matter is often indescribably puerile; and, though composed <i>bonâ fide</i>,
would look profane and licentious in quotation.</p>

<p>I have another edition, "chiefly extracted from the Larger Hymn-book,"
London, 1769. It has bad English, bad verse, and puerility; but is not
indelicate.</p>

<h3>
<span>WADY MOKATTEB NOT MENTIONED IN NUM. XI. 26.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 481.)</span>
</h3>



<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARGOLIOUTH</span>, in his communication on this subject, has not dealt
fairly with the text which he quotes. It is as follows:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
   one was Eldad, and the name of the other was Medad; and the
   Spirit rested upon them, and they were of them that were written,
   <i>but they went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied
   in the camp</i>."</p>

<p>The concluding clause, which I have printed in italics, has been omitted
by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARGOLIOUTH</span>, although it is plainly an essential part of the
passage, and necessary to the complete statement of the facts narrated.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARGOLIOUTH</span> would translate the passage thus: "And the Spirit rested
upon them, and they were in <i>The Cethubrin</i> (<i>i.e.</i> in Wady Mokatteb),
but they went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the
camp."</p>

<p>He does not, however, explain how Eldad and Medad were in Wady Mokatteb,
more than Moses and the rest of the seventy. The camp itself was in Wady
Mokatteb, according to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. <span class="smcap lowercase">MARGOLIOUTH'S</span> hypothesis, and therefore there
is no opposition between Eldad and Medad being there, and yet remaining
in the camp. But assuredly some opposition is evidently intended between
Eldad and Medad being &#1489;&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; amongst them that were written, and
the clause (omitted by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARGOLIOUTH</span>) "but they went not out unto the
tabernacle."</p>

<p>The authorized English version is in accordance with all the ancient
versions, the Chaldee paraphrase, and the commentators, Jewish as well
as Christian. And I think it gives also the common sense view of the
passage.</p>

<p>Moses had complained of the great burden which rested upon him. "I am
not able (he says) to bear all this people alone, because it is too
heavy for me." He was directed, therefore, to choose seventy men of the
elders of Israel; and God promised him "I will take of the spirit which
is upon thee, and will put it upon them, and they shall bear the burden
of the people with thee, that thou bear it not alone."</p>

<p>Accordingly Moses brought out the seventy chosen elders, and stationed
them round the tabernacle, and they there received the spirit of
prophecy in some visible manner, so as to make their divine commission
publicly known among the people; but two of them, named Eldad and Medad
(the text goes on to say) remained in the camp, and nevertheless they
also received the spirit of prophecy, for they were of them that were
written &#1489;&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (<i>i.e.</i> they were of the number of the seventy whom
Moses had selected), although they went not out to the tabernacle with
the others: "<span title="[Greek: kai houtoi êsan ek tôn katagegrammenôn]">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#953;
 &#7974;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957;
 &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span>, nam et
ipsi descripti fuerant," are the versions of the LXX. and Latin Vulgate.
And this is evidently the meaning of the passage; for if Eldad and Medad
had not been of the chosen seventy, they would have had no right to go
out with the<a id="Page_32"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[32]</span> others to the tabernacle, and the remark of the
historian, "that they remained in the camp <i>and went not out unto the
tabernacle</i>," would have been without point or meaning.
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARGOLIOUTH</span>,
therefore, was quite right to omit these words, as they completely
overturn his hypothesis.</p>

<p>Why these two elders remained in the camp is not expressly stated in the
inspired narrative. Raschi says,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
  &#8234;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1503; &#1513;&#1504;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1504;&#1493; &#1499;&#1491;&#1488;&#1497; &#1500;&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1494;&#1492;&#1475;
</p>


<p class="center">  "They were of those who were chosen, but they said, we are not
   sufficient for this great thing."</p>


<p>He goes on to tell us that Moses being perplexed how to choose seventy
elders out of the twelve tribes, without giving offence to some one
tribe by choosing a smaller number out of it, selected six out of each
tribe, which made seventy-two, and determined by lot the two who were to
be omitted. Raschi does not say (as Lightfoot, and after him, Bishop
Patrick, seem to have imagined) that the two rejected elders were Eldad
and Medad, for this would be inconsistent with the words just quoted,
where he ascribes their remaining behind to their humility and sense of
insufficiency for so great a work; and I need scarcely say that the text
of the Scripture gives no authority for the story of the seventy-two
chosen, and the two rejected by lot. But even this story sufficiently
proves that the ancient Jewish commentators understood the words
&#8234;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492; &#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; as they are rendered by our English translators. </p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. <span class="smcap lowercase">MARGOLIOUTH'S</span> conjecture, therefore, is totally without foundation;
it is not supported by any authority, and is even inconsistent with the
plain words of the text. I should be sorry to see "N. &amp; Q." made the
vehicle of such rash and unsound criticisms, and therefore I send you
this refutation of it.</p>

<p>With respect to Wady Mokatteb, it would be very desirable to have the
singular inscriptions there extant carefully copied by competent
scholars. Hitherto we have been forced to content ourselves with the
drawings sent home by chance travellers; would it not be possible to
organize a caravan of competent persons, having some knowledge of
oriental tongues and alphabets, to explore these interesting valleys,
and bring home correct transcripts of their inscriptions? Many noblemen
and gentlemen spend annually on travelling and yachting much more money
than would be necessary to organize such an expedition as I am
suggesting; and if a party put their funds together, and took with them
artists to make the drawings, with a couple of well qualified scholars
to assist in deciphering them, I think they might spend as pleasant, and
certainly a much more profitable, summer, than in ascending Mont Blanc,
or drinking sack in the Rhine steam-boats. Perhaps, also, the
improvements in the daguerreotype and talbotype processes might be made
available for securing absolute accuracy in the fac-similes of the
inscriptions.</p>

<p>In reference to these celebrated inscriptions, a remarkable statement
occurs in the <i>Journal Asiatique</i> for 1836, tom. ii. p. 182., of which I
annex a translation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "M. Fræhn has discovered in an Arabian author,
   Ibn-abi-Yakoub-el-Nedim, who wrote in 987, a passage stating that
   at that period the Russians already possessed the art of writing.
   This author has even preserved a specimen of Russian writing of
   the tenth century, which, he says, he received from an ambassador
   sent to Russia by one of the Princes of the Caucasus. These
   characters do not resemble the Greek alphabet, or the runes of
   the Scandinavian races. It would appear, therefore, that the
   first germ of civilisation in Russia preceded the establishment
   of Rurik and the Varangi in this country, instead of having been
   introduced by them. A circumstance of peculiar interest is, that
   these ancient Russian letters, so different from any other
   alphabet, have the greatest analogy with those inscriptions, yet
   unexplained, sculptured on the rocks of the desert between Suez
   and Mount Sinai, and noticed there in the sixth century of our
   æra. The analogy existing between these inscriptions placed on
   the confines of Africa and Asia, and others found in Siberia, had
   already been demonstrated by Tychsen. M. Fræhn is about to
   publish this interesting discovery."</p>

<p>Query, what ground is there for the above assertions, and what has been
since published in support of such a statement?</p>

<h3>
<span>BOILING TO DEATH AS A PUNISHMENT.<br />
(Vol. ii., p. 519.)</span>
</h3>


<p>L. H. K. gives an extract from Howe's <i>Chronicle</i>, detailing the
punishment of one <i>Richard Rose</i> (as also of another person) in the
above manner for the crime of poisoning, and inquires if this was a
peculiar mode of punishing of <i>cooks</i>. No reply to this having yet
appeared, and the subject being only incidentally mentioned at Vol.
iii., p. 153., I venture to submit to you the following Notes I have
made upon it.</p>

<p>The crime of poisoning was always considered as most detestable,
"because it can, of all others, be the least prevented either by manhood
or forethought." Nevertheless, prior to the statute of 22 Hen. VIII. c.
9. there was no peculiarity in the mode of punishment. The occurrence to
which Howe refers, appears to have excited considerable attention,
probably on account of the supposition that the life of the bishop was
aimed at; so much so, that the extraordinary step was taken of passing
an Act of Parliament, <i>retrospective</i> in its enactments as against the
culprit (who is variously<a id="Page_33"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[33]</span> described as <i>Rose</i>, <i>Roose</i>, otherwise
<i>Cooke</i>, and <i>Rouse</i>), prescribing the mode of punishment as above, and
declaring the crime of poisoning to be treason for the future. The
occurrence is thus related in a foot-note to Rapin, 2nd edit. vol. i. p.
792.:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "During this Session of Parliament [1531] one <i>Richard Rouse</i>, a
   <i>cook</i>, on the 16th February poisoned some soop in the Bishop of
   Rochester's kitchen, with which seventeen persons were mortally
   infected; and one of the gentlemen died of it, and some poor
   people that were charitably fed with the remainder were also
   infected, one woman dying. The person was apprehended; and by Act
   of Parliament poisoning was declared treason, and <i>Rouse</i> was
   attainted and <i>sentenced to be boiled to death</i>, which was to be
   the punishment of poisoning for all times to come. The sentence
   was executed in Smithfield soon after."</p>

<p>This horrible punishment did not remain on the Statute Books for any
very lengthened period, the above statute of Henry being repealed by
statutes 1 Edw. VI. c. 12., and 1 Mary, stat. I. c. 1., by which all
<i>new</i> treasons were abolished, since which the punishment has been the
same as in other cases of murder. If within the reach of any
correspondent, an extract from the statute of Henry would be
interesting.</p>

<span>THE ROMAN INDEX EXPURGATORIUS OF 1607.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 440.)</span>
</h3>


<p>U. U. will be extremely sorry to hear that he has not any reason for
persuading himself that his copy of this Index belongs to the original
edition. On account of the difference of spaces observed in the reprint,
each page, though containing only the same matter that appears in the
earlier impression, has been elongated to the extent required for three
lines. The Ratisbon octavo is generally about an inch taller, and a
third part thicker, than the Roman volume. The woodcuts are totally
distinct, and are better in the authentic book; and the <i>beau papier</i>,
of which Clement speaks, at once eliminates the modern pretender.</p>

<p>I have been able to obtain two copies of the genuine Vatican Index as
well as its Serpilian rival; and with respect to what your correspondent
calls "the <i>Bergomi</i>" (more properly the <i>Bergamo</i>) "edition" of 1608, I
beg to assure him that there is an "undoubted" exemplar likewise
producible, and that I have dispersed a thousand facsimiles of it since
the ear 1837.</p>

<p>U. U. has charged Mr. Mendham with having imagined that "Brasichellen"
was a "complete" word. I happen to know very well, and many of your
readers also know, that my excellent friend is not altogether such a
simpleton; but he will most probably not take the trouble on this
occasion to defend himself. The fact is, that the Serpilian counterfeit
alone is without the full stop in the case of this word, which in the
Bergamo titlepage ends at "Brasichell." The master of the sacred palace,
with whom we are now concerned, is very rarely mentioned as Giovanni
Maria da <i>Brisighella</i>, the designation which he rightly gives to
himself in his Italian edicts; and the Latinized forms <i>Brasichellanus</i>
and <i>Brasichellensis</i> easily arrive at English abridgments. In 1607,
when the Vatican Expurgatory Index was first published, the
Commissary-General of the Roman Inquisition was Agostino Galamini da
<i>Brisighella</i>, and his<a id="Page_34"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[34]</span> name is sometimes found recorded,
unstopped, as "Augustinus Galaminius <i>Brasichellen</i>."</p>

<h3>
<span>HOBBES'S "LEVIATHAN."<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 314. 487.)</span>
</h3>


<p>I am surprised that your correspondent H. A. B., who appears by his
expressions to be an admirer of the <i>Leviathan</i>, should think the
frontispiece an absurd conceit, very unworthy of its author. The design
may be regarded, I think, as a very remarkable embodiment of the thought
expressed in the passage where the term <i>Leviathan</i> is first used. The
civil body or commonwealth, derived from the union of individuals, is
represented by Hobbes as the origin of all rights and duties. And this
combination of men is (<i>Leviathan</i>, p. 87.) something more than consent
and concord. It is the real unity of them all in one and the same
person. The multitude, so united in one person, is called a
<i>Commonwealth</i>. "This is the generation," he says, "of that great
<i>Leviathan</i>, or, to speak more reverently" (that is, with the reverence
due to it), "of that <i>mortal God</i> to which we owe (under the <i>Immortal
God</i>) our peace and defence." This "mortal God," thus constituted, may
very fitly be represented by the giant image, made up of thousands of
individual forms, wielding the mighty sword and the magnificent crosier,
and spreading its arms, with an air of sovereignty, over castles and
churches, rivers and ports, fields and villages. The emblems then
represent, as H. A. B. observes, the manifestations of civil and of
ecclesiastical power; and the parallelisms there exhibited appear to me
to be curious: the castle, with a piece of ordnance discharged from the
walls; the church, with a figure of Faith on its roof; the coronet and
the mitre; the cannon, the thunderbolt of war; and the spiritual
fulmination, represented by the mythological thunderbolts; the arms of
Logic, Syllogism, and Dilemma, and the like; and the arms of war, pikes,
and swords, and muskets; and finally, the judiciary tribunal, and the
tribunal of the battle field, the <i>ultima ratio regum</i>.</p>

<p>The frontispiece in the edition of 1651 is a much better print than that
of 1750; and in the former, I think, the resemblance to Cromwell is
undeniable. In this edition, the tablet at the bottom has the words,
"London: <i>Printed for Andrew Crooke</i>, 1651." In the edition of 1750
there are on the tablet the words, "<i>Written by Thos. Hobbs</i>, 1651," as
C. J. W. states.</p>

<span>MAJOR-GEN. JAMES WOLFE.<br />

<p>If the follows remarkable lines, described to me as having been placed
many years ago under a bust of General Wolfe, in the Old Castle at
Quebec, should not be well known, I think they merit a place in your
pages. My friend who sent the verses could not supply the author's name,
nor state whether they still remain <i>in situ quo</i>, though I have some
idea that the Old Castle was burnt:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Let no sad tear upon his tomb be shed.</p>
   <p>   A common tribute to the common dead.</p>
     <p> But let the Good, the Generous, and the Brave,</p>
<p>      With godlike envy, sigh for such a grave."</p>

</div>

<p>I may as well add, in reply to the Query in your 113th No., page 504.,
that my worthy friend and neighbour, Mr. Richard Birch Wolfe, the
present representative of the Wolfes of North Essex, upon inquiry at the
College of Arms, was unable to trace any relationship between his family
and that of the General.</p>

 <p class="right">   B<span class="smcap lowercase">RAYBROOKE</span>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wolfe's maiden name was Henrietta Thompson; she was of a Yorkshire
family, and "own sister to my sister Apthorp," says Cole, "the wife of
the Reverend Dr. Apthorp, Fellow of Eton College, so that my nieces
Frances and Anne Apthorp were first cousins to the General." This lady
died on Wednesday, Sept. 26, 1764, at her house in Greenwich, and is
described as "the relict of Col. Edward Wolfe, and mother to the late
heroic General Wolfe." (<i>Public Advertiser</i>, Sept. 28, 1764.) The
official letter from General Wolfe, dated Sept. 9, 1759, is in print. On
Nov. 18, in that year, his body was landed from the "Royal William" at
Portsmouth. Three affecting letters of the bereaved mother to William
Pitt, dated Nov. 6th, 27th, 30th, are likewise published. On March 26,
1759, she had been left a widow by her husband Edward, who was in 1745
Colonel of H. M. 8th regiment of infantry, and appointed
Lieutenant-General in 1747. In 1758, General James Wolfe was Colonel of
H.M. 67th regiment of foot. By her will, Mrs. Wolfe devised 500<i>l.</i> to
the maintenance and repairs of Bromley College (<i>Cambridge Chronicle</i>,
Sat. April 27, 1765); and, her debts and legacies being first paid,
bequeathed the residue of her property to poor and deserving persons,
with preference to the widows and families of soldiers who had served
under her gallant son. The applicants were to send in their names to
Jas. Gunter, attorney, of Tooley Street, Southwark, before Jan. 1, 1766
(<i>Whitehall Even. Post</i>, Thursday, Aug. 22, 1765). The monument to Gen.
Wolfe's memory, in Westerham Church, is of white marble, and set up over
the south door. The inscription has been given already in Vol. iv., p.
322.; but with the omission of any mention of a black tablet beneath,
inscribed "I, decus, I, nostrum." He was baptized on Jan. 11, 1727. I

<p>In Vol. iv., p. 271., inquiry is made for the parentage of the mother of
Gen. Wolfe. I have accidentally discovered, in turning over Burke's
<i>Landed Gentry</i> (p. 1389.), that she was a Thompson. Sir Henry Thompson,
who was three times married, had, by his first wife, Henry, M.P. for
York, the grandfather of Jane, married to Sir Robert Lawley, by whom she
was mother of Paul Beilby Thompson, late Lord Wenlock. By his third
wife, Susanna Lovel, Sir Henry had a son Edward, who married a lady
named Tindal, and had issue, Edward, also M.P. for York; Francis, a
lieut.-colonel; Bradwarden, a captain; Mary, married to General Whetham;
and "Henrietta, mar. Colonel Wolfe, and was mother of General Wolfe,
killed at Quebec."</p>

<p>Will it serve your correspondent <span title="[Gh.]">&#540;.</span>, to state that at Inversnaid, on
the borders of Loch Lomond, where Wordsworth met his immortalised
"Highland Girl," there is a ruined fort, erected in 1716 to keep the
clan Gregor in order, and which was taken and retaken, repaired and
dismantled, but which, after the rebellion of '45, was occupied by the
king's troops? There is a tradition that General James Wolfe was, for a
time, stationed here. This tradition is referred to in all the guide
Books, but no precise date is given.</p>

<p>In the United States Institution there is a pencil profile of General
Wolfe. It was presented to that collection by the Duke of Northumberland
(when Lord Prudhoe).</p>

<p>On the back of the sketch itself are written these words:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "This sketch belonged to Lieut.-Col. Gwillim, A.D. Camp to Genl.
   Wolfe when he was killed. It is supposed to have been sketched by
   Harvey Smith."</p>

<p>On the back of the frame there is a paper, with the following
inscription:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"This portrait of General Wolfe, from which his bust was
   principally taken, was hastily sketched by Harvey Smith, one of
   his aid-de-camps, a very short time before that distinguished
   officer was killed on the plains of Abraham. It then came into
   the possession of Colonel Gwillim, another of the General's
   aid-de-camps, who died afterwards at Gibraltar; and from him to
   Mrs. Simcoe, the Colonel's only daughter and heiress; then to
   Major-General Darling (who was on General Simcoe's staff); and is

<h3>
<span>"THERE IS NO MISTAKE."<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 471.)</span>
</h3>


<p>It may, perhaps, have puzzled others of your readers, as for some time
it did myself, to account for your correspondent F. W. J. having
undertaken to prove that the Duke of Wellington did not first use "those
celebrated words" <i>there is no mistake</i>, in his "reply to Mr.
Huskisson." F. W. J. shows that the Duke wrote "the sentence now so well
known" is 1812. No doubt he did: and it may not unreasonably be assumed
that he had used it many hundred times before under similar
circumstances. F. W. J. evidently confounds those words used by the Duke
in their natural sense with the slang phrase which has been current for
some years, and owes its origin, I believe, to a character in a farce,
"and no mistake." The slang phrase is used by way of binding or
confirming; as, for instance, "I will be there at two o'clock, <i>and no
mistake</i>,"&mdash;the latter words being equivalent to "You may depend on it:"
if, indeed, it be possible to fix a precise meaning to words so
improperly applied. It is hardly necessary to say, that in both the
instances referred to by your correspondent, the Duke used the words in
their natural and proper sense. F. W. J. is wrong in supposing that the
Duke used the phrase in his "reply to Mrs. Huskisson;" it was to Lord
Dudley his Grace addressed the words. Mr. Huskisson having voted against
his colleagues on the question of transferring the franchise from East
Retford to Birmingham, went straight from the House of Commons to his
office in Downing Street, and wrote a letter to the Duke, then Prime
Minister, announcing that he lost no time in affording<a id="Page_36"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[36]</span>  his Grace
an opportunity of placing his (Mr. Huskisson's) office in other hands,
as the only means in his power of preventing the injury to the King's
service which might ensue from the appearance of disunion in His
Majesty's councils, &amp;c. On receipt of Mr. Huskisson's note, the Duke
wrote to that gentleman stating that he had deemed it his duty to lay
his note before the King. It happened that the Duke's note reached Mr.
Huskisson whilst he was engaged in conversation with Lord Dudley, to
whom he had been describing his own note to the Duke, and speaking of it
(strange enough) as if it had not been a tender of resignation. When Mr.
Huskisson showed Lord Dudley the Duke's letter, which showed that his
Grace took a different view of the matter, his Lordship, knowing what
Mr. Huskisson had been telling him, naturally enough said that the Duke
must be labouring under a mistake. But this incident was narrated with
so much <i>naïveté</i> by Mr. Huskisson himself, that I am tempted to quote
his words (spoken in the House of Commons) as they were reported in the
<i>Times</i>, June 3, 1828:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Upon showing this (the Duke's) letter to Lord Dudley, so struck
   was he with the the different import which the Duke of Wellington
   attached to the matter from that which was impressed on himself
   by the previous conversation, that he remarked, 'Oh, I see the
   Duke has entirely mistaken your meaning: I will go and see him,
   and set the matter right.' (A laugh.) Lord Dudley returned
   shortly after seeing the Duke, and said, 'I am sorry to say I
   have not been successful. He (the Duke) says it is no mistake; it
   can be no mistake; and (if Mr. Huskisson's relation of the words
   were not imperfectly heard, for he let his voice drop repeatedly)
   it shall be no mistake." (Loud laughter.)</p>

<h3>
<span>THE REV. MR. GAY.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 388.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I am greatly obliged by the communication of your correspondent relative
to the Gays connected with Sidney College. It was as from that quarter I
expected light. The passage in Paley's <i>Life of Law</i>, which is to me of
considerable interest, long ago attracted my attention, although it
escaped notice at the moment when I ventured to send my first inquiry.
It runs as follows:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Our Bishop always spoke of this gentleman in terms of the
   greatest respect. In the Bible, and in the writings of Mr. Locke,
   no man, he used to say, was so well versed."</p>

<p>Thus I find the passage quoted from Paley in Nichols' <i>Literary
Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century</i>, vol. ii. p. 66. Bishop Law also
mentions him in a letter to Dr. Zach. Grey, editor of <i>Hudibras</i>:
"Respects to <i>honest</i> Mr. Gay, and all friends in St. John's." The
letter was written from Graystock, May 31, 1743. The full address of Dr.
Grey unfortunately is not given where I find the letter, in the same
vol. of Nichols, p. 535. But we may safely gather from it, that at that
time "<i>honest</i> Mr. Gay" was at Cambridge, and in esteem; whether a
resident, as should seem most likely from the manner of the notice, or a
casual visitor, does not certainly appear. If a resident, this is not
consistent with the idea of your correspondent, that he became vicar of
Wilshamstead, Bedfordshire, and vacated his fellowship before 1732. I
wish that the identity of the author of the Dissertation with the John
Gay&mdash;first in the list of your correspondent&mdash;an identity to which my
mind also inclines, could be more clearly made out. He was born, and
partly educated, in Devonshire.</p>

<p>A private correspondent has very kindly furnished me with a few
particulars relative to Nicholas Gay, the second mentioned in your
correspondent's list, and father of the fourth, which Nicholas was vicar
of Newton St. Cyres, near Exeter, and died, æt. seventy-five, in 1775;
and to another, Richard Gay, rector of St. Leonard, near Exeter, who
died in 1755. Of this Richard Gay, on a stone in the church of
Frithelstock, near Torrington, it is said that&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"To great learning, he added a most exemplary life in constant
   faithful endeavours to support religion, to glorify God, and to
   do good to man. He was equalled by few, surpassed by none of the
   age he lived in."</p>

<p>To such a character, one would gladly attach the Dissertation in
question, but no Richard Gay, it appears, is mentioned in the records of
Sidney College. There were many Gays in Devonshire of the family of John
Gay the poet.</p>

<p>Permit me to make another inquiry: Is there any tolerably good account
in existence of the private or domestic life of the celebrated Lord
North, minister and favourite of George III.? Of his political career, a
pleasing sketch is given by Lord Brougham, in his <i>Historical Sketches
of Statesmen</i>, and many delightful anecdotes of his incomparable temper
and playful wit are known; but of his domestic history I cannot find a
trace.</p>

<h3>
<span>PARISH REGISTERS, RIGHT OF SEARCH.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 473.)
</span>
</h3>

<p>As the Query herein appears to be one which it is more the province of
the lawyer to answer, I take the liberty of submitting the following for
your correspondent's consideration.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical mode of registration appears now to be regulated by
52 Geo. III. c. 146., which still remains in force (except with regard
to marriages, which was repealed on the introduction of<a id="Page_37"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[37]</span> the civil
method) as far as regards baptisms and burials; and by the 16th section
of that act, a proviso is enacted, that nothing in that act should
diminish or increase the fees theretofore payable, or of right due, to
any minister for the performance of the <i>before</i>-mentioned duties, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The before-mentioned duties here referred to were, that they (the
officiating ministers) should keep the registers of public and private
baptisms, marriages, and burials in books for that purpose provided by
the parish, that they should as soon after the solemnisation of the
ceremony as possible enter it in the register. That such Register Books
should be kept in the custody of the minister in an iron chest, which
was to be kept locked, except for the purpose of making the entries as
above, <i>or for the inspection of persons desirous to make search
therein</i>, or to obtain copies, or for production as evidence, or for
inspection as to their condition, or for the purposes of that act. That,
within a stated period, the ministers should make copies (annually) of
the registers, verify them, and transmit the copies to the registrar of
the diocese. Now these just mentioned are the duties referred to in the
act, so far as they concern our inquiry; and the fees payable have been
the fee of one guinea for keeping the registers, a fee allowed by the
parish for sending copies of them to the registrar of the diocese; but I
do not observe any fee for any person searching, or even obtaining
copies of any entry of baptism or burial, if they feel so disposed.</p>

<p>The civil method of registration is regulated by the 6 &amp; 7 Will. IV. c.
86.; and by the 35th section it is enacted:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"That every rector, vicar, or curate, and every registrar,
   registering officer, and secretary who shall have the keeping for
   the time being of any Register Books of <i>births</i>, <i>deaths</i>, or
   marriages, shall at all reasonable times allow <i>searches</i> to be
   made of any <i>Register Book</i> in his keeping, and shall give a copy
   certified under his hand of any entry or entries in the same on
   payment of ... for every search extending over a period not more
   than one year, the sum of one shilling, and sixpence additional
   for every additional year; and the sum of two shillings and
   sixpence for every single certificate."</p>

<p>This will be seen to comprehend such Register Books as apply to births
and deaths only, and not to those containing baptisms and burials (which
latter are only in the custody of the officiating ministers); and
although some doubts may arise from the words "allow searches to be made
of <i>any Register Book</i> in his keeping," I am of opinion that "the
Register Book" here meant "in his keeping" only applies to the
description just preceding, viz. of "<i>births and deaths</i>." I am inclined
to think that no fee is payable legally to the minister <i>for searching</i>
the Register Books of <i>baptisms or burials</i>, nor even for making a copy
of an entry therein by any persons if they feel disposed to take a copy
themselves.</p>

<p>In the same act, sec. 49., a provision is enacted that nothing in that
act shall affect the <i>registration</i> of baptisms or burials as then by
law established, or the right of any officiating minister to receive the
usual fees for the <i>performance or registration</i> of any baptism, burial,
or marriage: so that there is nothing even in this controlling clause
last quoted, that at all affects the right of persons to search without
fee the registers of baptisms or burials, or even of making copies; for
that clause simply refers to the fact of registering, and the fees
payable for solemnising the same, and the registration, although I am
not aware that there is a fee for registering a baptism, although it was
so in William III.'s reign.</p>

<p>By the 12th sect. of the 52 Geo. III. c. 146. (the latter part of it), I
find that the copies of the registers which are transmitted by the
minister annually to the registrar of the diocese, are to be arranged,
and an alphabetical list of names to be made by the registrar; and such
copies and list to be open to <i>public search</i> at all reasonable times
upon <i>payment of their usual fees</i>. This of course does not apply to the
<i>baptismal or burial registers</i> in the custody of the minister; but it
is quoted that your correspondent may be in possession of the whole
facts, for it is undoubtedly most important to the genealogical or
archæological inquirer. If I am wrong, I shall be glad to stand
corrected on the error being pointed out.</p>

 <span class="pagenum">[38]</span> J.S. (Vol. iv., p. 410.), in reply to my Query,
informed me had passed through the press of Messrs. Blackwood and Sons,
"with a preface or dissertation containing many particulars relating to
the authoress and her relatives," my object in mentioning the subject in
"N. &amp; Q." has been satisfactorily answered. I am also obliged to J.S.
(the editor, I apprehend, of this new edition) for having corrected the
errors into which I had unintentionally fallen; nor will my neighbour,
the Rev. C.H. Crauford, I am sure, feel less obliged.</p>

<p>It now appears that this new reprint is copied <i>verbatim et literatim</i>
from the third impression printed at London, by John Haviland for <i>Hanna
Barres</i>, 1625. My Query also has been the means of ascertaining from
another correspondent, P. B. (the initials, I believe, of one of the
most correct of bibliographers in names and dates), a notice of what he
believes to be the <i>first</i> edition printed by John Haviland for <i>William
Barret</i>, 1624. But, as Blackwood's edition is dated 1625, and is called
the <i>third</i> edition, is it not very probable that an earlier one
appeared than even that of 1624?</p>

<p>Should the notice I have attracted to Mrs. Joceline's <i>Mother's
Legacie</i>, and the letter accompanying it, addressed, "in the immediate
prospect of death, to her truly loving and most dearly beloved husband,"
be the means of extending the sale and the perusal of this beautiful
little pocket volume, "replete with practical wisdom and hallowed
principles, that no human being who is not past feeling can read without
deep emotion," I shall be truly gratified: and it will be another
instance of the utility and value of "N. &amp; Q." being the medium of
bringing such books before the public eye.</p>

in this neighbourhood on which this ornament appears.</p>

<p>The first is in Macclesfield church. In the north aisle is an
altar-tomb, with the effigies of a knight in plate armour, with a collar
of SS. At his feet is a ball; and under his head, which is uncovered, a
helmet with crest and lambrequin. The crest is too much defaced to be
made out, but in a sketch made in 1584 is figured as a stag's head.
Tradition assigns this tomb to one of the family of Downes; but it is
surrounded by the monumental effigies of the Savages (one being that of
the hero of Bosworth), and bears the arms of Archbishop Savage, who is
said to have repaired it.</p>

<p>The other, which is an exceedingly beautiful monument, and in excellent
preservation, is in the chancel of Barthomley church. It is an embattled
altar-tomb: on the sides are figures, somewhat mutilated, of knights and
ladies, sculptured in bas-relief, under richly crocketted gothic
canopies. The knight is in plate armour, with a coif de mailles and
pointed helmet (<i>exactly</i> of the same character as the effigy of Edward
the Black Prince in Canterbury Cathedral), and wears a collar of SS.
most elaborately carved. It is known as the tomb of Sir Robert
Fulleshurst, one of the four esquires of the gallant James Lord Audley
at the battle of Poictiers, who died in 13 Rich. II. (In Bunbury church,
there is an alabaster altar-tomb to Sir Hugh Calveley, the famous
Captain of "Companions" at the battle of Najara, who died 1394. It is so
exactly similar in every respect, with the exception of the collar of
SS., to that of Sir Robert Fulleshurst, that of the sketches I have made
of both you could not distinguish one from the other.)</p>

<p>There are also said to be effigies bearing the<a id="Page_39"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[39]</span> collar of SS. in
the churches of Cheadle, Mottram, Over Peover, and Malpas, of which I

<span><i>Use of Misereres</i></span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 307.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The following facts may serve
towards deciding the use of "miserere" chairs in old churches. In the
Greek church, near London Wall, every seat is on the miserere
construction. During those parts of the service (and they are very
frequent) where the rubric requires a standing posture, the worshipper
raises the stall to support the person, which it does in a very
sufficient manner.</p>

<p>In the parish church of Mere, in Wiltshire, the "misereres" are
furnished with hooks, to prevent their falling down again when once
elevated.</p>

blessed, happy), and the other word a contraction for <i>Erbe</i> or <i>Erben</i>,
heir or heirs. I interpret it, "Peter Conrad Wiegel, heir of the late

<p>&mdash;In answer to D.'s enquiry
whether there is any proof of this cavalier having been engaged in

standard at Nottingham, and to his "many eminent services against the
rebels, as well in the first happy defeate given to the best of their
cavalrye in the fight near Worcester, as at Kineton, Braynford,
Marleborough, Newbery, and at many other places, where he hath received
severall wounds." D. is probably not aware of the very copious memoirs

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent
S<span class="smcap lowercase">IR</span> J. E. T<span class="smcap lowercase">ENNENT</span>, in extracting from his volume on <i>Modern Greece</i>
(vol. ii. p. 266.), has given fresh currency to a singular error. The
Council of Trullo was cited by him in 1830, and is again quoted as
ordering "that thenceforth fiction and allegory should cease, and <i>the
real figure of the Saviour be depicted on the tree</i>;" and we are
referred to <i>Can. 82. Act. Concil.</i> Paris, 1714, v. iii., col. 1691,
1692. But should your readers turn to the canons of that council they
would be disappointed at finding nothing about the cross, and one is
curious to know how an historian could have been led into so singular a
mistake. Johnson (see <i>Clergyman's</i><a id="Page_40"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[40]</span> <i>Vade Mecum</i>, Part II., p.
283. third edit.) thus gives the substance of the canon:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "82. Whereas, among the venerable pictures, the Lamb is
   represented as pointed at by the finger of his forerunner [John
   the Baptist], which is only a symbol or shadow; we, having due
   regard to the type, but preferring the anti-type, determine that
   he be for the future described more perfectly, and that the
   portraicture of a man be made instead of the old Lamb: that by
   this we may be reminded of His incarnation, life, and death."</p>

<p>And though I have not the precise edition at hand to which

<span><i>Borough-English</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 133. 214. 235. 259.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Watkins'
<i>Copyholds</i> furnishes in its appendix a list of the customs of different
manors, and therein specifies those which are subject to the custom of
Borough-English. With regard to there being any instance on record of
its being carried into effect in modern times, there must not be a
mistake between the custom which now exists, and that which some authors
assert was the origin of it. The custom is, that the youngest son
inherits in exclusion of his eldest brothers; this is exercised, or it
could not exist. But the custom to which reference has been made, as
having been stated by some authors to be the origin of the existing
custom of Borough-English, is not mentioned by Littleton as such. He
gives a different reason, namely:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">   "Because the younger son, by reason of his tender age, is not so
   capable as the rest of his brethren to provide for himself."</p>


<p>And Blackstone adduces a third from the practice of the Tartars, among
whom, on the authority of Father Duhalde, he states that this custom of
descent to the youngest son also prevails, and gives it in these
words:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "That nation is composed totally of shepherds and herdsmen; and
   the elder sons, as soon as they are capable of leading a pastoral
   life, migrate from their father with a certain allotment of
   cattle, and go to seek a new habitation. The youngest son,
   therefore, who continues latest with the father, is naturally the
   heir of his house, the rest being already provided for. And thus
   we find that among many other northern nations, it was the custom
   for all the sons but one to migrate from the father, which one
   became his heir. So that possibly this custom, wherever it
   prevails, may be the remnant of that pastoral state of our
   British and German ancestors, which Cæsar and Tacitus describe."</p>

following, the whole estate was purchased for 4350<i>l.</i> by Mr. John
Starky of Rochdale, a successful attorney, in whose representative it is
now vested. The Tonges deduced their descent from Thomas de Tonge,

the family of Prestwich of Prestwich), living 7 Edw. II. 1314, as
appears by an elaborate pedigree of the family (sustained by original
evidences), in my possession, and at the service of J. B.</p>

parish no doubt takes its name of Hatfield Broad Oak. There is a print
of this tree in Arthur Young's <i>Survey of Essex</i>.</p>

<p>If the rural readers of "N. &amp; Q." will observe whether the finest
specimens of oaks have their<a id="Page_41"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[41]</span> acorns growing, on long or short
stalks (<i>quercus sessiliflora</i> or <i>pedunculata</i>), they might throw much
light on the questions, Have we two distinct English oaks? and, if so,
Which makes the largest and best timber? The timber used inside old
buildings, and erroneously often called chesnut, is supposed to be the
sessiliflora variety of oak, placed inside because it is not so durable
as the quercus pedunculata. But I have been lately informed this variety
is in Sussex selected, as the best, for Portsmouth Dockyard!</p>

<p>In the year 1783 my grandfather first drew attention to the two
varieties of English oaks, in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, p. 653. He was
brother of Gilbert White of Selborne, and an equally acute observer of
Nature. Loudon, in his <i>Arboretum</i>, has collected much information, but
has left the question pretty much where it was seventy years since.
Surely it is time we knew precisely what is the tree of which our wooden
walls are made.</p>

<span><i>Deep Wells</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 492.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;Besides streams and sunk wells, there
is of course another source of water arising from natural springs; and
there are some on both sides of the Banstead Down, which are very
considerable. The chief, probably, is the source of the River Wandle, at
Carshalton, pronounced (with the same omission of the <i>r</i> which P. M. M.
notices) as if it was spelt <i>Case-</i>, or <i>Cays-horton</i>.</p>

<p>But there is a very strong one at Merstham. These are both at the foot
of the Chalk hills. P. M. M. does not mention the geological causes on
which the relations between wells or springs depend. About thirty-five
years ago the spring at Merstham, which feeds a considerable spring,
failed, and there was a great dispute whether it was owing to
excavations in the neighbourhood. An action was brought, which decided
that it was not attributable to them; upon which I believe Mr. Webster
and Mr. Phillips, eminent geological authorities, were examined, and
which led, perhaps, to their respective accounts, in the <i>Geological
Transactions</i>, of the structure of that valley. The story was, that,
after having gained the cause, the proprietor of the quarries said, "I
think we may let them have their water back again." Certain it is that
after some time the water did return.</p>

<p>The Galt clay almost everywhere underlies chalk: this at Merstham is 200
feet thick, and upon the pitch and situation of it many apparently
strange phenomena of wells would depend, as is noticed with regard to
another clay stratum at Norton St. Philips, near Bath, in Conybeare and
Phillips' <i>Geology</i>.</p>

<p>There are very deep wells throughout the London clay, and other beds
below it, perhaps, at Wimbledon and at Richmond Park. The deep well at
Carisbrook Castle is well known. That is in the chalk; and where, the
chalk being thrown into a vertical position, it may be still farther to
the bottom of it.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Objective and Subjective</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 11.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;From the tone of X.'s
inquiry into the meaning of this antithesis, it is tolerably plain that
no answer will make <i>him</i> confess that it is intelligible; yet it was
familiar in the best times of our philosophical literature, and the
words, according to this, their philosophical opposition, occur in
Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i>. I think it is desirable to avoid this
phraseology, but the meaning of it may be made clear enough to any one
who wishes to understand it. The <i>object</i> on which man employs his
senses or his thoughts, are distinct enough from the man himself, the
<i>subject</i> in which the senses and the thoughts exist. Several years ago
an Edinburgh Reviewer complained that Germans, and Germanized
Englishmen, were beginning to use <i>objective</i> and <i>subjective</i> for
<i>external</i> and <i>internal</i>. This is a sort of rough approximation to the
meaning of the terms. But perhaps the distinction is better illustrated
by examples. We call Homer an objective, Lucan a subjective, poet,
because the former tells his story about external objects and wants,
interposing little which belongs to himself. Lucan, on the other hand,
is perpetually introducing reflections arising from the internal
character of his own mind. Objective truth is language which agrees with
the facts, correctness. Subjective truth is language which agrees with
the convictions of the speaker, veracity.</p>

<p>Perhaps X. will allow me to ask in turn, what is "a physical ignoramus,"
the character in which he begs some of your intelligent readers to
enlighten him.</p>

<p>I have said above that I think this mode of expressing the antithesis
better avoided; I will state why. It puts the man who thinks, and the
objects about which he thinks, side by side, as if they were alike and
co-ordinate. It implies the view of some one who can look at both of
them; whereas, the thing to be implied is the opposition between being
looked at and looking. Hence <i>subjective</i> is a bad word; a man is not,
in ordinary language, the <i>subject</i> of his own senses or of his own
thoughts, merely because they are in him. The antithesis would be better
expressed in many cases, by the words <i>objective</i> and <i>mental</i>, or
<i>objective</i> and <i>cogitative</i>. But different words would be eligible in
different cases.</p>

<span><i>Lord Say and Printing</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 344.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Milman's edition of
<i>Gibbon's Autobiography</i>, there occurs a passage respecting his
ancestor, Lord Treasurer Say, from which it appears that the great
historian doubted the accuracy of Shakspeare's allusion (which he
quotes). I have not the book with me, or I would refer M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">RAZER</span> to the
page. I think Gibbon would not have rested content with a mere assertion
of his opinion, if a fact so creditable to his ancestor's understanding
were capable of proof.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Age of Trees</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 401. 448.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Since the note on the age of
trees appeared, my attention has been called to a discussion of the
subject in an article on Decandolle's <i>Vegetable Physiology</i>, written I
believe by Prof. Henslow, in the <i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i>, vol. xi. p.
368-71. With respect to the yew near Fountains Abbey, he remarks as
follows:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "In the first of these examples, we have the <i>testimony of
   history</i> for knowing that this tree was in existence, and must
   have been of considerable size, in the year 1133, <i>it being
   recorded</i> that the monks took shelter under it whilst they were
   rebuilding Fountains Abbey."&mdash;p. 369.</p>

<p>Query: Where is this historical testimony to be found? Nothing is said
on the subject in the account of Fountains Abbey in Dugdale's
<i>Monasticon</i>, vol. v., p. 286. ed. 1825.</p>

<p>With respect to the Shelton Oak (Vol. iv., p. 402.) the movements of
Owen Glendower, at the time of the battle of Shrewsbury, are accurately
detailed in the life of him inserted in Pennant's <i>Tours in Wales</i>, vol.
iii., p. 355. (ed. 1810); and the account there given is inconsistent
with the story of his having ascended a tree in order to count Percy's
troops. It appears that at the time of the battle he was at Oswestry, at
the head of 12,000 men.</p>

<p>Lord Campbell, in his <i>Lives of the Chief Justices</i>, describes the
suicide of Sir William Hankford, Chief Justice in the reigns of Henry V.
and VI., who is said to have contrived to get himself shot at night by
his own keeper. Lord Campbell quotes Prince, the author of the <i>Worthies
of Devon</i>, p. 362. as stating that&mdash;</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "This story is authenticated by several writers, and the constant
   traditions of the neighbourhood; and I, myself, have been shown
   the rotten stump of an old oak under which he is said to have
   fallen, and it is called <i>Hankford's Oak</i> to this day."&mdash;See

<span><i>Grimes-dyke</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 454.)</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondents appear to have
overlooked <i>Offandíc</i>, <i>Wodnesdíc</i> (so often mentioned in the Saxon
charters), and <i>Esendike</i>&mdash;doubtless so named in memory of Esa, the
progenitor of the kings of Bernicia&mdash;and <i>Gugedíke</i>, which I suspect is
an old British form for Gog's dike (Fr. <i>Yagiouge</i>), as well as
<i>Grimanleáh</i> (Wood of Horrors), and <i>Grimanhyl</i>. It is true we find the
<i>Grimsetane-gemáero</i> in Worcestershire (<i>Cod. Dipl.</i>, No. 561.); but we
also find <i>Wódnesbeorg</i> (<i>Id.</i> No. 1035.). Allow me to give you the
substance of a remark of Professor H. Léo of Halle on this subject.
(<i>Ang. Säch. Ortsnamen</i>, p. 5.)</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Wild, dismal places are coupled with the names of grim, fabulous
   creatures: thus, in Charter 957, King Eadwig presented to Odo,
   Archbishop of Canterbury, a territorial property at 'Hel-ig' (on
   the Islet of Helas). A morass is cited which is called, after the
   ancient mythological hero, <i>Grindles-mère</i>; a pit,
   <i>Grindles-pytt</i>; a small islet surrounded with water&mdash;which was
   to an Anglo-Saxon a "locus terribilis"&mdash;was called <i>Thorn-ei</i>
   (the thorn tree being of ill omen). And thus, in order to express
   the ordinary associations connected with neighbourhood, recourse
   was had rather to mythic personages, than to abstract
   expressions."</p>

<p>I would here observe that the <i>Ortsnamen</i> has been for some time in
course of translation, with the Professor's sanction and assistance,
with a view to its publication in England.</p>

<p>&mdash;E. N. W. is assured that the petition for the recall of the Duke
of Wellington was presented. Being too ill to travel several miles to a
public library, I can only refer to works in which a reference to it
will be found. In No. XIX. of the late <i>British and Foreign Quarterly</i>,
published by Messrs. Taylor, Red Lion Court, Fleet Street, is an extract
from the admirable letter of his Grace to Lord Liverpool on the subject;
and in Colonel Gurwood's edition of the <i>Wellington Dispatches</i>, on
which the article alluded to is written, and which contains much
interesting matter relating to his Grace not to be found any where else,
is the whole dispatch. I asked for information relative to the petition,
because I had heard that it had been destroyed, and it was too droll a
document to be allowed to be lost.</p>

<p>&mdash;In the <i>Wonders of the Universe, or Curiosities of
Nature and Art</i>, vol. ii., p. 555., will be found the account of this
affair. The culprit was named Louise Mabrée, a midwife in Paris; the
corpses of no less than sixty-two infants were found in and about her
house: she was sentenced to be shut up in an iron cage with sixteen wild
cats, and suspended over a slow fire. When the cats became infuriated
with heat and pain, they turned their rage upon her; and after
thirty-five minutes of the most horrible sufferings, put an end to her
existence,&mdash;the whole of the cats dying at the same time, or within two
minutes after. This occurred in 1673.</p>

<p>&mdash;A. A. D. will surely thank
me, if his Note on the subject do not contain it, for the <i>rationale</i>,
which Sir Thomas Brown gives, <i>Religio Medici</i>, Part ii. p. 9., of the
occurrence of verses in Latin prose:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "I will not say with Plato, the soul is an harmony, but
   harmonical, and hath its nearest sympathy unto music: thus some,
   whose temper of body agrees, and humours the constitution of
   their souls, are born poets, though indeed all are naturally
   inclined unto rhythm. This made Tacitus, in the very first lines
   of his story, fall upon a verse (<i>Urbem Romam in principio regis
   habuere</i>); and Cicero, the worst of poets, but declaiming for a
   poet, falls, in the very first sentence, upon a perfect
   hexameter: <i>In qu&#257; me non inficior mediocriter esse</i>."</p>

<p>&mdash;As I was the
querist concerning this work and its author, and wanted the information,
I was very thankful for the satisfactory answers given. The books
referred to by R. G. are not inaccessible: whether then it be needful to
occupy your columns with the "particulars" required by E. A. M. (Vol.
iv., p. 458.) may be a query too. The first word of the title is as
above (not Blackloanæ, as your correspondents have it). E. A. M. will
find that Blacklow, or Blakloe, is a soubriquet, as well as Lominus.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;On examining the book, however, I am not convinced that Peter
Talbot was its "real author," though extensive use is made of what he
had written; or that "Lominus" is an "imaginary divine," even if the
name be a feigned one. On what ground do these assertions rest?</p>

<p>&mdash;A
M<span class="smcap lowercase">EMBER OF THE</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">OCIETY OF</span> F<span class="smcap lowercase">RIENDS</span>, who writes on the subject of a <i>Quaker Expurgated Bible</i>,
appears to be unaware of the existence of a work once (I believe) well
known in that body. This was an epitome or compendium of the Bible by
John Kendall; it contained the greater portion of the Word of God, such
parts being excluded as the editor did not consider profitable. It is
probably to this book that the authoress of <i>Quakerism</i> refers; I have,
however, never seen her work. This mutilated Bible of John Kendall was
frequently to be met with formerly in the houses of members of the
Society of Friends; as I have not seen it for more than twenty years, I
cannot tell what its exact date may be; it was, however, published in
the days when all religious publications of the Society of Friends
<i>were</i> subject to the approval of a committee. In 1830, George Witley
published a list of those chapters in the Bible which were "suitable"
for reading in "Friends'" families; amongst other portions he excluded
(I believe) the 16th of Leviticus and Psalm xxii. In <i>private</i> he
thought the whole might be read; but he says that he prepared this index
because of having heard <i>very unsuitable</i> matter read aloud! This

<p>&mdash;E. H. D. D. is in error; the
Wyle Cop at Shrewsbury is <i>not</i> an artificial bank, but a natural
eminence overlooking the Severn; and I cannot agree with him in the
immateriality of the meaning attached to <i>Wyle</i>. The associations
connected with names are frequently of great topographical and
historical value. There are many singular names of streets, &amp;c., in
Shrewsbury, which I should be glad if any of your correspondents can
interpret, such as "Mardol," "Shop latch," "Bispestanes," and "Dogpole;"
also the derivation of "Shut" in the sense of <i>passage</i> or entry, a
synonym with the Liverpool "Wient," which seems equally uncertain.</p>

<p>If it be true, as we are inclined to believe, that there is no one
subject in the whole wide range of speculative studies, to which the
well-worn saying of Hamlet, that there are more things true than are
dreamt of in our philosophy, may be applied with so much propriety as
Animal Magnetism,&mdash;so we are also inclined to believe that a perusal of
the two volumes recently published by Mr. Colquhoun under the title of
<i>An History of Magic, Witchcraft, and Animal Magnetism</i>, will tend to
convince our readers that to the same subject may be applied the yet
older saying, that there is nothing new under the sun. Mr. Colquhoun,
who many years since published his <i>Isis Revelata</i>, has long been a
diligent inquirer into the nature and origin of the different phenomena
of animal magnetism; and it would appear from the work before us, he has
also been a persevering reader of all the various accounts of magic,
witchcraft, and other so-called popular delusions, recorded by the
writers of antiquity, and the chroniclers of the middle ages; as well as
of those more modern mysteries (such as<a id="Page_45"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[45]</span> the Gustavus Adolphus
Story, the Death of Ganganelli, &amp;c.) which seem to increase in interest
just in proportion as they approach to our own <i>more enlightened</i> days.
As in all the extraordinary tales which he brings forward, our author
sees only manifestations of well-known mesmeric phenomena, it may well
be imagined that, in recording the result of these examinations and
studies, he has probed two volumes which, if they do not satisfy all our
requirements upon the subject, will be found of most considerable
interest, not only to all who believe in Animal Magnetism, but to all
who care to investigate the nature of the human mind, its organization,
and the laws which govern its action.</p>

<p>The success which has attended the publication of Mr. Buckley's
translation of <i>The Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent</i>, and the
approbation bestowed upon that work by several of the highest
dignitaries of the English Church, have led him to publish <i>The
Catechism of the Council of Trent translated into English with Notes</i>;
and there can be little doubt, from the anxiety which now exists to
learn, from sources which cannot be disputed, both the points on which
we differ from Rome, and those on which we agree with Rome, that the
success which followed Mr. Buckley's translation of the Decrees will be
extended to his English version of the <i>Catechism of the Council of
Trent</i>.</p>

<p class="center2">BAGSTER'S POLYGLOT BIBLES.</p>

<p>The elegant manner in which these well-known Books are got up, renders
them especially eligible as PRESENTATION COPIES of the "Sacred
Scriptures." Bound in Bagster's peculiar style of flexible Turkey
morocco; of durable beauty, and enriched with every external adornment,
their typographical completeness is enhanced. The Miniature Polyglot, or
small pocket size, the Foolscap Octavo, pocket size, and the Facsimile
Large-Print Edition, all correspond page for page, and in their
combinations with the Book of Common Prayer, Indexes, Concordances,
Lexicons, etc., afford a variety suited to every requirement. The
"Comprehensive Family and Pulpit Bible," containing the largest number
of parallel references and illustrative notes ever published, is kept,
of various quarto sizes, bound up with Family Registers, in plain and
sumptuous bindings. The "Hexapla" is a treasury of the most condensed
criticism. It consists of the Greek Text of the New Testament, printed
in the largest type, with six standard English translations beneath it,
arranged for comparison in parallel columns. Kept in every style of best
binding. "The Bible of Every Land," now just completed, is a collection
of interesting Memoirs of every Language into which the Bible has been
translated, with engraved Specimens, numerous coloured Maps, and a full
series of Native Alphabets. "The Blank Paged Bible," "The Biblia
Ecclesiæ Polyglotta," "The Large-Print Critical Greek Testament and
Septuagint" may also be suggested as suitable gifts. See descriptive
Catalogues, which are furnished without charge, and sent free by post.</p>
